# Gravity-shooter
Abstract





Gravity Shooter is an innovative multiplayer adventure game designed to immerse players in a fun, interactive learning experience, with a primary focus on physics and machine learning (ML).
The game uses a dynamic 2D environment and elements like gravity manipulation to deliver educational content. As players navigate a map densely populated with trees, rocks, and various other obstacles, the game presents a unique challenge in accurately aiming and hitting the targets. It is here that the ML aspect of the game shines.
ML algorithms analyze the playerâ€™s current situation in real-time, including the target's distance, the player's position, and the prevailing gravity. Using this information, the algorithm suggests the optimal shooting angle and power to the player, thus enhancing their likelihood of hitting the target. The integration of ML within the gameplay not only assists in improving the player's aim but also provides an engaging method of learning and applying physics principles. As players become more familiar with the ML suggestions, they begin to intuitively understand and apply the principles of trajectory, force, and gravity.
The game is developed using various cutting-edge technologies, including new advancements in machine learning, and will be hosted on AWS servers. The game will be tested and evaluated with a range of tools to ensure it fulfills its intended purpose and caters to a wide variety of interested individuals.
