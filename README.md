# Gravity-shooter
Abstract





Gravity Shooter is an innovative multiplayer adventure game designed to immerse players in a fun, interactive learning experience with a primary focus on physics and machine learning (ML). The game features a dynamic 2D environment and employs elements like gravity manipulation to deliver educational content. As players navigate through a map densely populated with trees, rocks, and various other obstacles, they face the unique challenge of accurately aiming and hitting targets.

In a dedicated training screen, the ML algorithm analyzes the playerâ€™s current situation in real-time, including the target's distance and the player's position. Using this information, the algorithm suggests tips to help the player improve their aim. Players train their shooting skills with the help of ML on this dedicated screen before choosing to play in either solo or multiplayer modes.

A distinctive feature of multiplayer mode is the ability for players to manipulate their opponents' gravity or force, adding an extra layer of strategy and interaction. This manipulation allows for dynamic gameplay where players must not only master their own abilities but also anticipate and counteract the modifications imposed by their opponents.

The integration of ML within the game not only assists in enhancing the player's skills but also provides a method of learning and applying physics principles. As players become more familiar with the ML suggestions, they begin to intuitively understand and apply the principles of trajectory, force, and gravity.

The game is developed using various cutting-edge technologies, including new advancements in machine learning. It has been thoroughly tested and evaluated with a range of tools to ensure it fulfills its intended purpose and caters to a wide variety of interested individuals.
